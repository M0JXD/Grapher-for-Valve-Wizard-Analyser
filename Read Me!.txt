Here are the files for the App and the modified Arduino code I used.

The Application was made using an Environment called "Processing". It's one of the things that inspired Arduino, and has an in-built RS-232 serial function library, 
the main reason I chose it. Otherwise it's a simple yet fancy graphics API set for Java with added preprocessing to make things easier 
(For example, global variables are allowed in Processing but don't exist in Java).

The code is certainly not "professional" as I'm by no means a good coder, however it's functional and that's certainly enough for me!

The "FauxValveAnalyser" is the code I used to emulate the real thing, because I haven't built any hardware yet. 
It just sends some values over Serial as your's would do anyways.

It requires G4P and graphica libraries/tools to run
